<p>Adludio, a mobile ad company, had given a task with a machine learning solution that bridges the gap between textual concepts and visual storytelling. And so, this system automates the creation of storyboards from textual descriptions of advertisement concepts and assets. By automating this process, it will significantly speed up ad campaign creation, allowing clients to launch campaigns faster and with fewer resources. This project leverages advancements in machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision to improve efficiency and creativity in digital advertising.</p>

<p>How it went about:</p>

<hr />

<pre>
You open your eyes, and you are greeted by an unfamiliar ceiling.
Startled, you get to your feet and quickly scan your surroundings. It's
dark except for the stream of light coming from a crack on the only boarded
window in the room. You try to peek through the crack, but you cannot see
anything. You wonder where you are and who could have possibly brought you here.

&lt;--------------------help------------------------&gt;
Enter quit or one of the following commands -
Weld light look walk pickup inventory help h ?
&lt;------------------------------------------------&gt;

look
The room is a picture of decay with only a faded number identifying it as room-4. The bed you were
 lying on is stained with what looks like dried blood. Could it be your blood? No - it is not. The
 only way out of the room aside from the door to the corridor is a window that is boarded shut. It
 looks like it has been like that for decades. There is a door going west from here. You see a candle
 on the floor. You see a match on the floor.

pickup candle

The candle is now lit. It illuminates everything in the room.

walk west
The corridor is lit with the candle. It is so long that you cannot see to the end. You notice that
 there are words written on the wall. There is a door going east from here. There is a way going north
 from here. There is a door going south from here.
